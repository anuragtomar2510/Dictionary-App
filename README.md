This English Dictionary App features a simple and clean design, allowing users to search for any English word and hear its pronunciation. If a user enters a non-existent word, the app suggests similar terms, helping users find what theyâ€™re looking for. The interface is user-friendly and responsive, making it easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile devices. Whether you're a student, a writer, or just curious about language, this app is a handy tool for enhancing your vocabulary. Explore the world of words with ease! Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it leverages The Merriam-Webster Dictionary API which can be found [here](https://www.dictionaryapi.com/products/api-learners-dictionary) for accurate and reliable definitions.
